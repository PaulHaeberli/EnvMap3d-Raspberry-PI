#EnvMap for Raspberry PI

NOTE: 

    This app will only run if the 

    Experimental desktop GL driver is off
    you can change this setting by doing:

    sudo raspi-config
    selecting 9 - Advanced Options, then
    selecting AC - GL Driver, then
    selecting No, and restarting

    I have only tested this on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
    I am working on makeing this work with the desktop
    GL driver running!
  
    
To Install and Run:

    1. Do
        sudo make install

    2. go to the PIXEL appliction menu and click on "Graphics"

    3. click on "EnvMap3d"
